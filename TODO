FireBase PloneDemo:



Problems solved initially:

  + angular-firebase is a newer version, so we have to include angularFire.js. @done (13-04-15 12:45)

  - need to add ++resource++angular.js to RR profile. @cancelled (13-04-15 11:54)

  + the production of ++resource++angular.js needs a Gruntfile.js. @done (13-04-15 12:40)

  - cancel-submit button.



Future:

  - angular-firebase is a newer version, so we have to include angularFire.js. Find the bower package so we don't need this!

  - Find also a firebase.js that currently comes from CDN

  - The gruntfile should rather be in the src package, but then error.
