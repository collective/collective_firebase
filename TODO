Problems solved initially:

  + angular-firebase is a newer version, so we have to include angularFire.js. @done (13-04-15 12:45)

  + need to add ++resource++angular.js to RR profile. @cancelled (13-04-15 11:54) @done (13-04-22 16:19)

  + the production of ++resource++angular.js needs a Gruntfile.js. @done (13-04-15 12:40)

  + cancel-submit button. @done (13-04-22 16:17)

  + The gruntfile should rather be in the src package, but then an error occurs. @done (13-04-22 16:17) - I made the buildout and the egg to be a combined package.


Future:

  - angular-firebase is a newer version, so we have to include angularFire.js. Find the bower package so we don't need this!

  - Find also a firebase.js instead of the one that currently comes from CDN.
